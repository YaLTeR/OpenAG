### Visual Studio 2019

## macOS
1. Install Xcode.
2. Install CMake via Homebrew.
3. `git submodule update --init`
4. `mkdir build`
5. `cd build`
6. `cmake ..`

Half-Life 1
======================

This is the README for the Half-Life 1 engine and its associated games.

Please use this repository to report bugs and feature requests for Half-Life 1 related products.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter an issue while using Half-Life 1 games, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue;
- your system information.\*; and
- the `version` output from the in‐game console.

Please place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

\* The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`). Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`. Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block.

Conduct
-------


There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Half-Life.  As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested.  Patience is always appreciated.
